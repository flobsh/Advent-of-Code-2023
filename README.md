# Advent of Code 2023

This is my take at [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), using Rust.

## Goals

- Multi-bin crate: each day has its own binary executable, all based on the template found in the [src/lib.rs] file.
- Functional (mainly iterators) programming style: I try to solve problems using the Rust built-in iterators as much as possible.
- No external crate: everything uses the standard Rust library.

## Non-goals

- Performance/efficiency: as much as I try to avoid any unecessary computation, I do not aim for speed and efficiency.
